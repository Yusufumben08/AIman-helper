An ai linux command line helper 

It can summarize how to use a command directly in your terminal, and you can respond to it for more info. Like a more interactive  man command.

To use:

- get openrouter api key at ai.hackclub.com

- run ./aiman -key (api-key) to set the key

- optionally run ./aiman -install for easier access in any directory

- Done! Now run ./aiman -help to see all commands (or just aiman -help if you installed it.)
